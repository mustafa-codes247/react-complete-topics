usecontext:

is used to manage state (change variable value) globally , 
as we can pass values from parent to child components using props
but to use them in grandchild components , we have to pass that prop
to each related child component ,thats called prop drilling and it
affects the speed of website , to avoid this , we use useContext.

useRef:

is used to access dom elements directly without reRendering the component.
as all other hooks reRender the component which affect the speed of website
