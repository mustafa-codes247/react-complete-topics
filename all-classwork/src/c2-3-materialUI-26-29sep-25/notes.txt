material ui was very popular 2 years ago but after tailwind css , it became less popular ,
because it has different types of syntax than html,js but tilwind is similar

installation:
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material


we use <Stack/> instead of div 
<Typography/> instead of simply writing h1,p or pre
direction={row/column} isntead of flex flex wrap


so we just did practice of material ui but tailwind was used afterwards

DELETION:
we then deleted the packages from package.json file from dependencies or devdependencies onject


basic syntax for reference:

import React from "react";
import { Button, Typography, Container, TextField } from "@mui/material";
import { AddCircle } from "@mui/icons-material";

function App() {
  return (
    <Container style={{ marginTop: "2rem" }}>
      <Typography variant="h4" gutterBottom>
        Welcome to Material UI ðŸš€
      </Typography>

      <TextField
        label="Enter your name"
        variant="outlined"
        fullWidth
        margin="normal"
      />

      <Button
        variant="contained"
        color="primary"
        startIcon={<AddCircle />}
        onClick={() => alert("Hello from MUI!")}
      >
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </Container>
  );
}

export default App;
