material ui was very popular 2 years ago but after tailwind css , it became less popular ,
because it has different types of syntax than html,js but tilwind is similar

installation:
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material


we use <Stack/> instead of div 
<Typography/> instead of simply writing h1,p or pre
direction={row/column} isntead of flex flex wrap


so we just did practice of material ui but tailwind was used afterwards

DELETION:
we then deleted the packages from package.json file from dependencies or devdependencies onject
