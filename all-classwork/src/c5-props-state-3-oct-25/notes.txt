props are properties and data that are used in child functions from parent functions
props are immutable (unchangeable)
they are used as parameters


states are mutable data that can be used as arguments and can be used with array of objects
with iteration of .map loop so that the data gets put into ui dynamicallly

we have to import useState on top to use it
we made multiple examples using useState
