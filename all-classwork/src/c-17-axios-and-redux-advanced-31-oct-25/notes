in this class we learnt 2 things:

1-axios :
    to call the api (json data fetching)
    we use this to avoid using (.then) 2 times as 
    it handles converting to json automatically

axios functions:

1-axios.post: add new data
2-axios.delete: delete data
3-axios.put: update (complete) data
4-axios.patch: update specific data (less used)

we also learnt about promises:

when api (json data) is called,
it works on promises basis means 
at 1st it is at pending state,
then 2ndly it is fulfilled.
if not fulfilled , it is rejected.

if calling multiple apis , finally is used too.

1-pending
2-fulfilled
3-rejected
4-finally

2-Redux-toolkit-advance:

we fetched data using redux toolkit , earlier we only used it for just counter funciton but redux is more than that.

we made slice js file(function)
postSlice.js and useSlice.js

naming is camelCase
